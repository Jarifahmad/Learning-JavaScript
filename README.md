These are the notes I wrote down while learning about JavaScript through "TheOdinProject" course, and many other resources! <br>
# DOM manipulation 
<b>DOM - Document object model</b> <br>
The DOM (or Document Object Model) is a tree-like representation of the contents of a webpage - a tree of “nodes” with different relationships depending on how they’re arranged in the HTML document. <br>
<br>
<b>Targeting nodes with selectors</b> <br>
When working with the DOM, you use “selectors” to target the nodes you want to work with. You can use a combination of CSS-style selectors and relationship properties to target the nodes you want. <br>
<br>
<b>DOM methods</b> <br>
When the HTML code is parsed by a web browser, it is converted to the DOM.<br>
